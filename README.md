Hi, Iâ€™m Anthony, and I'm a healthcare consultant based out of Chicago, IL. I've been learning frontend software development in my spare time and my goal is to switch careers within a year.
I love solving problems while getting a chance to flex my creative side, which is why I've found so much satisfaction creating small projects and tinkering with designs and layouts of websites.
I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

More about me:
- I'm an avid Bears fan #BearDown,
- I love Korean fried chicken,
- and I'm in a weekly euchre league.

I'd love to connect and talk about frontend development; I am also looking for mentorship, whether that's informal or formal - feel free to DM me!
