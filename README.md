Hi, Iâ€™m Anthony. I'm a healthcare consultant based out of Chicago, IL. I've been learning frontend software development in my spare time.

I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NextJS. 

I'd love to connect and talk about frontend development; I am also looking for mentorship, whether that's informal or formal - feel free to DM me!
