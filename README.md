I'm Anthony and I'm based out of Chicago, Illionis. My main gig is healthcare consulting. Technology/software is a hobby of mine outside of work. I love finding unique ways to use it to improve the quality of life. I've been learning software development in my spare time to satiate this curiousity and interest and have primarily focused on frontend development but have also explored backend development. 

Languages/technologies I have experience with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Handlebars.js
- Tailwind CSS
- React
- Next.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- SQL
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

Feel free to shoot me a DM if you want to connect!
