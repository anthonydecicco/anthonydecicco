Hi, Iâ€™m Anthony. I'm a healthcare consultant based out of Chicago, IL. I've been learning frontend software development in my spare time.

I have experience with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- NextJS

I'd love to connect and talk about software development; I am also looking for mentorship, whether that's informal or formal - feel free to DM me!
